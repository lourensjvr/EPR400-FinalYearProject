# EPR400-FinalYearProject
A system was developed and implemented on FPGA, that allows a physical replica of "Pong" to be played against a robot. The system allows a player to control the movement of the player paddle and trigger the actuation of the paddle. The system uses input from a camera to estimate the trajectory of a player hit ball, and through a control system position the robot paddle, that is actuated by another control system, to hit the ball back in the player's direction. The speed at which the user and robot paddle is actuated at will increase slowly until a goal is scored. The system detects when a goal is scored by a player or the robot and keeps track of scoring.
